I read, watch, travel, run, bike, take photographs, and dance. In the meantime, I try to learn. If somehow I manage to learn or create something new, then there is a pretty good chance that you will find it out in this website.

For the ones interested with my career, you can take a look in the CV.  For the rest, I will sporadically share some of my writings in the blog. Maybe, I will add some of my favorite photographs which I have been taking over the years. For now, I do not know how much technical writings you will find other than my publication list, because I easily get bored when I try to write technical documents (shhh, please don't tell anyone).

Dear visitor, I hope you will be able to find something worth your time. If you can not, please do not hesitate to move forward to a new sea in the (almost) infinite waters of the internet ocean. Welcome!

PS. This is a bilingual website with Turkish and English, which I do not guarantee that you can find all the content in both languages. In case of you are interested with a translation, please do not hesitate to ask for it and I will do my best.
